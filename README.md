# Subterranean-Waters
Adds a companion world gen features that creates large oceans, lakes, and biome border rivers under the overworld land mass.

## Differences from Underground Ocean
- Does not generate in existing water biomes, configurable.
- Can be deactivated in biomes of your choosing.
- Reverted to the 1.7.10 code as the 1.11.2 code was really screwed up.
